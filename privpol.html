<h2 class="aboutdesc">Your privacy is of utmost importance here on the Alerts Manager team. We believe that transparency is <br />a core value of any organisation.<br />

    The info we collect includes:<br />
    We keep the idâ€™s for the staff members who need access to the staff commands on the bot.<br />
    We have custom code for staff to access the staff commands on my dashboard but we have this setup to auto generate letters and numbers.<br />
    We have a file to store the rank people would like the bot to mention when a YouTube video or Twitch streams when they post into the chat.<br />
    We keep the ID`S of YouTube and Twitch access so we can track how many accounts a server has so they do not go over the limit.<br />
    We also have a partner rank so this will show in the file as well.<br />
    We have Custom commands on the dashboard so we can see all the commands they have set as well <br />
    I will delete the records if someone asks me to and provides the ID of the server.<br />
    The only people who have access to this is me and 2 other trusted developers we also have 2fa on are online dashboard for the bot and a different password to login to the vps. <br />
    
    If a user would like to talk about this you are able to open a ticket up in discord.
